\# SOP-WO-002 — Evidence \& Attachments Requirements (Photos, Readings, Screenshots) — CSUDH Pilot



\*\*Status:\*\* Active  

\*\*Applies To:\*\* All work orders; stricter rules when compliance triggers exist  

\*\*Owner:\*\* Facilities Ops  

\*\*Version:\*\* 1.0  

\*\*Last Updated:\*\* 2025-12-31



---



\## Purpose

Make every WO defensible and useful later by standardizing attachments:

\- Proof the work happened

\- Proof the equipment stabilized

\- Proof compliance steps were followed (when triggered)

\- Prevent “tribal knowledge loss”



---



\## Attachment Types (Examples)

\- Photos (phone camera)

\- PDFs (contractor report, invoice, quote)

\- BAS screenshots (graphics, trends, alarms)

\- Meter photos (amps/volts, pressure, temperature)

\- Console/log output (connector/scanner logs)



---



\## Minimum Evidence Rules (Always)

Every WO must include \*\*at least ONE\*\* attachment:

Choose one:

\- Before/after photo

\- BAS screenshot of final stable readings

\- Contractor report photo/PDF

\- Nameplate photo

\- Test measurement photo



---



\## Enhanced Evidence Rules (Compliance / Refrigerant / High-Risk)

If compliance triggers exist (see SOP-COMP-001), WO must include:

1\. Nameplate/tag evidence (refrigerant type/charge) \*\*OR\*\* documentation excerpt

2\. Evidence of leak check / recovery / recharge (report/photo)

3\. After-work evidence (photo or BAS screenshot)



---



\## “What to Capture” Cheat Sheet

\### Mechanical repair

\- Before photo of failed area

\- After photo of repair

\- If replaced part: photo of old part (optional but helpful)



\### Controls/BAS related

\- Screenshot of point values before/after

\- Screenshot of alarm cleared (if relevant)

\- Note: DO NOT change control logic unless authorized (outside connector scope)



\### Refrigerant work

\- Nameplate photo

\- Leak check evidence

\- Contractor paperwork



\### Networking/scanner activity

\- Screenshot of scan output summary

\- Exported device list file (if generated)



---



\## File Naming (Recommended)

When saving locally or uploading:

\- `WO-1234\_Before.jpg`

\- `WO-1234\_After.jpg`

\- `WO-1234\_Nameplate.jpg`

\- `WO-1234\_Trend.png`

\- `WO-1234\_ContractorReport.pdf`



---



\## Where to Attach

\- Primary location: Work Order attachments

\- Secondary: Compliance Event attachments (if triggered)

\- If the system supports it: link attachments to the Asset record too



---



\## Closeout Gate

WO cannot be closed if:

\- No attachments exist, OR

\- Compliance trigger exists and required evidence is missing, OR

\- Notes are too vague to understand what changed
