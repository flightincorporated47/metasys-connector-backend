\*\*Owner:\*\* Facilities / Central Plant  

\*\*Version:\*\* 1.0  

\*\*Last Updated:\*\* 2025-12-31

\## Purpose

Ensure every contractor visit is logged consistently with an audit trail: \*\*who\*\*, \*\*why\*\*, \*\*when\*\*, \*\*what changed\*\*, and \*\*evidence captured\*\*.



---



\## When to Use

Use this SOP anytime:

\- A contractor arrives on site for a WO (scheduled or unscheduled)

\- A contractor performs diagnostic work, maintenance, repair, or testing

\- Refrigerant equipment is involved (see SOP-COMP-001)



---



\## Required Inputs

\- Work Order ID (WO-####)

\- Contractor company + technician name

\- Scope of work / task description (short + specific)

\- Equipment / asset ID (if known)

\- Building / area

\- Any permits or approvals required (if applicable)



---



\## Required Evidence (Minimum)

At least \*\*ONE\*\* item must be attached to the WO:

\- Photo of work area \*\*before\*\*

\- Photo of work area \*\*after\*\*

\- Photo of equipment nameplate / tag

\- Reading screenshot (BAS trend, gauge photo, meter photo)

\- Contractor report PDF/photo



> If refrigerant work is performed, see SOP-COMP-001 and SOP-WO-002.



---



\## Check-In Procedure

1\. \*\*Open the Work Order\*\*

&nbsp;  - Confirm correct WO and site location.

&nbsp;  - Verify asset/equipment record exists or note “Asset ID unknown”.



2\. \*\*Log Visit Start\*\*

&nbsp;  Record in the WO:

&nbsp;  - Contractor company

&nbsp;  - Technician name(s)

&nbsp;  - Arrival time

&nbsp;  - Work scope summary (1–3 bullets)



3\. \*\*Safety + Access\*\*

&nbsp;  - Confirm escort requirements (if needed).

&nbsp;  - Confirm lockout/tagout responsibility (campus or contractor).

&nbsp;  - Confirm roof access / mechanical room access authorization.



4\. \*\*Baseline Evidence\*\*

&nbsp;  Attach at least one baseline item:

&nbsp;  - Photo of area/equipment OR

&nbsp;  - BAS screenshot of current readings OR

&nbsp;  - Photo of nameplate/tag



5\. \*\*If Refrigerant Equipment Is In Scope\*\*

&nbsp;  - Stop and follow \*\*SOP-COMP-001\*\* before allowing refrigerant circuit work.



---



\## During Work (Progress Logging)

\- Add short progress notes in WO as needed:

&nbsp; - “Found leak at \_\_\_\_”

&nbsp; - “Replaced \_\_\_\_”

&nbsp; - “Adjusted setpoint \_\_\_\_”

&nbsp; - “Performed test \_\_\_\_”

\- Capture key evidence when something changes (parts replaced, readings changed, alarms cleared, etc.)



---



\## Check-Out Procedure

1\. \*\*Confirm Work Completed vs Deferred\*\*

&nbsp;  - Completed / Partially completed / Deferred (waiting parts / approval / access)



2\. \*\*Record Departure\*\*

&nbsp;  - Departure time

&nbsp;  - Summary of what was done (3–6 bullets)

&nbsp;  - Any follow-up actions required and who owns them



3\. \*\*Attach Final Evidence\*\*

&nbsp;  Minimum required:

&nbsp;  - Photo after work OR screenshot of stable readings

&nbsp;  - Contractor report (if provided)

&nbsp;  - Any invoices/quotes if applicable (optional module)



4\. \*\*Update WO Status\*\*

&nbsp;  - If completed: confirm closeout requirements satisfied (especially compliance triggers)

&nbsp;  - If not completed: leave clear next steps + schedule notes



---



\## Quality Gate

A contractor visit is \*\*not considered “logged”\*\* unless:

\- Arrival/departure are recorded \*\*AND\*\*

\- At least one evidence attachment exists \*\*AND\*\*

\- Refrigerant/AQMD triggers were addressed when applicable



---



\## Common Mistakes

\- Logging “contractor on site” with no names/times

\- Closing WO without attachments

\- Refrigerant work performed without compliance trigger steps



---
