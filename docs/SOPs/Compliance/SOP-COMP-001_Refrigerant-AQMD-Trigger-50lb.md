\# SOP-COMP-001 — Refrigerant / AQMD Compliance Trigger (≥50 lbs or AQMD-Applicable) — CSUDH Pilot



\*\*Status:\*\* # SOP-COMP-001 — Refrigerant / AQMD Compliance Trigger (≥50 lbs or AQMD-Applicable) — CSUDH Pilot



\*\*Status:\*\* Active  

\*\*Applies To:\*\* Any work involving refrigerant equipment or circuits  

\*\*Owner:\*\* Facilities Compliance / Central Plant  

\*\*Version:\*\* 1.0  

\*\*Last Updated:\*\* 2025-12-31



---



\## Purpose

Automatically enforce a compliance workflow when:

\- Equipment refrigerant charge is \*\*≥ 50 lbs\*\*, OR

\- Equipment is flagged \*\*AQMD applicable\*\*, OR

\- Work involves \*\*opening the refrigerant circuit\*\*, adding/removing refrigerant, leak repair, or recovery.



This SOP creates an audit trail and prevents “oops, we forgot compliance” moments.



---



\## Trigger Conditions (Any one triggers this SOP)

Trigger if:

1\. \*\*Equipment charge ≥ 50 lbs\*\*, OR

2\. Equipment record marked \*\*AQMD\_applicable = true\*\*, OR

3\. Contractor/tech indicates work includes:

&nbsp;  - Refrigerant recovery

&nbsp;  - Adding/recharging refrigerant

&nbsp;  - Leak check / leak repair

&nbsp;  - Replacing compressor/coil/valve/drier that opens circuit



---



\## Required Inputs

\- Equipment / asset ID (or “unknown” + location)

\- Refrigerant type (e.g., R-410A, R-134a, etc.)

\- Estimated charge (lbs) if known

\- Work type (repair, leak check, recharge, recovery)

\- Contractor license info if contractor is performing refrigerant work (as available)



---



\## Required Evidence (Minimum)

Attach to the Work Order:

\- Photo of nameplate OR asset tag showing refrigerant type/charge, \*\*or\*\*

\- Existing documentation excerpt showing charge/type, \*\*and\*\*

\- Leak check result evidence (photo/report) when leak work is performed



---



\## Procedure

\### Step 1 — Confirm Trigger

1\. Check equipment record fields:

&nbsp;  - Refrigerant type

&nbsp;  - Charge lbs

&nbsp;  - AQMD applicable flag

2\. If unknown:

&nbsp;  - Capture \*\*nameplate photo\*\* and record best-known details in WO notes.



\### Step 2 — Create / Verify Compliance Event

In the app/workflow:

\- Create a \*\*Compliance Event\*\* linked to WO and asset:

&nbsp; - Event type: “Refrigerant Work / AQMD”

&nbsp; - Trigger reason: “≥50 lbs” or “AQMD applicable” or “Circuit opened”

&nbsp; - Date/time + technician/contractor



> If your system auto-creates this event: verify it exists before proceeding.



\### Step 3 — Required Acknowledgements

Before refrigerant circuit work begins, confirm:

\- Read-only connector policy does not change BAS controls (if BAS involved)

\- Safety requirements acknowledged (PPE, LOTO)

\- Refrigerant handling compliance acknowledged (EPA/contractor qualifications)



\### Step 4 — Work Documentation Requirements (Based on Work Type)

\*\*Leak check / leak repair\*\*

\- Record leak location (component + approximate area)

\- Record method used (electronic detector, bubbles, pressure decay, etc.)

\- Attach evidence (photo/report)



\*\*Recovery / recharge\*\*

\- Record:

&nbsp; - Amount recovered (lbs) if measured

&nbsp; - Amount added (lbs) if measured

&nbsp; - Cylinder ID or invoice reference if available

\- Attach contractor paperwork if provided



\*\*Component replacement\*\*

\- Record replaced component

\- Record whether circuit was opened

\- Attach before/after photos where reasonable



\### Step 5 — Closeout Gate (Do not close WO without this)

Compliance Event must include:

\- Who performed work

\- What was done

\- Evidence attachments present

\- Follow-up requirements documented (retest date, monitoring, parts pending, etc.)



---



\## Quality Gate

WO cannot be marked “complete” if:

\- Trigger condition exists and no Compliance Event is logged, OR

\- No evidence attachments exist, OR

\- Refrigerant type/charge remain unknown and no nameplate evidence was captured
